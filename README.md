#  React To-Do List App  

A simple yet powerful **To-Do List application** built with React.  
This app allows users to **add, edit, delete, mark complete, search, filter, and clear tasks** with data persistence using **localStorage**.  

---

##  Features :
-  Add tasks easily with an input field  
-  Mark tasks complete/incomplete by clicking on them  
-  Delete tasks individually  
-  Edit tasks without removing them  
-  Clear all tasks in one click  
-  Task counter → shows how many tasks are left  
-  Search tasks with live filtering  
-  Filter tasks → All / Active / Completed  
-  Persistent storage using localStorage (tasks remain after refresh)

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite or Create React App)  
- **Styling:** CSS  
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage  

---

##  Learnings
This project helped in understanding:

- Controlled inputs with **useState**  
- Updating arrays immutably (`map`, `filter`, spread `...`)  
- Using **useEffect** for side effects (sync with localStorage)  
- Conditional rendering in React  
- Organizing CSS for components

##  Future Improvements
-  Dark Mode toggle  
-  Task priority levels (High/Medium/Low with colors)  
-  Backend integration with a database (MongoDB / Firebase)  
-  Responsive UI for mobile devices
